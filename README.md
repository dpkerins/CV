I recently moved to the UK with my partner, leaving an eight-year career in the film distribution industry. I took this major life change as an opportunity to make the leap into the tech world and recently completed an intensive software development Bootcamp at Makers Academy.
 
What I love about coding is that it feels like solving a puzzle or doing brain teasers, while simultaneously getting to create something. I relish getting to bring a new feature to life or work through learning a new language or technology. During my time at Makers, I worked primarily with Ruby and Javascript. I learned a lot at my time at Makers, but there is always more to learn. I look forward to building a career in the Tech Industry. I am currently learning C#, Typescript and MaterialUI. 
 
I am looking to begin a career in London with a role as a Junior Developer. 

Tech Skills: Javascript, Ruby, React, Rails, Sinatra, Express.JS, Node.Js, CSS, Prisma, PostgreSQL

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

- <strong>Fast Self Learner</strong>: I am great at teaching myself new skills in order to complete a project. At Makers, I picked up React and Prisma in order to use them for our final project, both of which were new to everyone on our team. As a member of a two-person growing sales team in my past work, teaching myself new skills like Excel, EDI systems, Sales Management Softwares, was a regular part of my work. In a Junior Developer role this will allow me to be adaptable when working on new projects and technologies.

- <strong>Attention to Detail</strong>: My strong attention to detail allows me to create code that yields the desired specific results with DRY readable code. In my work in sales operations I handled many accounts, sales, contracts and supply chain. The complex sales reporting and processing required a strong eye for detail in order to become as profitable as possible. Film Distribution is a royalty business and requires the most accurate sales reporting and accounting to be successful. Though I have an aptitude for attention to detail, I never let perfectionism stop me from achieving and creating a workable result.

- <strong>Critical Thinking</strong>: One example of my critical thinking is in my work with big box store distributors (fulfilling product to Walmart, BestBuy etc). The sales reporting they provide is deeply complex and required me to use, shipping histories, cumulative and current sales reports and accounting records to create a system to accurately track their sales and the money they owed us. My excel skills came in very handy here as well. I bring this same critical thinking to my coding, like tweaking an existing code snippet to create a solution to a current problem or diagnosing an error.
