I recently moved to the UK with my partner, leaving an eight-year career in the film distribution industry. I took this major life change as an opportunity to make the leap into the tech world and recently completed an intensive software development Bootcamp at Makers Academy.
 
What I love about coding is that it feels like solving a puzzle or doing brain teasers, while simultaneously getting to create something. I relish getting to bring a new feature to life or work through learning a new language or technology. During my time at Makers, I worked primarily with Ruby and Javascript. I learned a lot at my time at Makers, but there is always more to learn. I look forward to building a career in the Tech Industry. I am currently learning C#, Typescript and MaterialUI. 
 
I am looking to being a career in London with a role as a Junior Developer. 

Tech Skills: Javascript, Ruby, React, Rails, Sinatra, Express.JS, Node.Js, CSS, Prisma, PostgreSQL
 

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

- <strong>Fast Learner</strong>: I am great at teaching myself new skills in order to complete a project. At Makers, I picked up React and Prisma in order to use them for our final project, both of which were new to everyone on our team. As a member of a two-person growing sales team in my past work, teaching myself new skills like Excel, EDI systems, Sales Management Softwares, was a regular part of my work. 
- <strong>Attention to Detail</strong>: 
- <strong>Critical Thinking</strong>:
